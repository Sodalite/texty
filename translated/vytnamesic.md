# Výt na měsíc

If I were maybe a wolf or a dog 
I wouldn't have to speak Wouldn't have to talk 
Just eat my dinner and go for a walk 
And howl at the moon 

And if I were laying there just like you 
All curled up the way dogs do 
I'd dream that dream that you're dreamin' too 
And howl at the moon 

Výt na měsíc 
výt na měsíc 

And if I could carry your black and white 
Sleep so sound wake so nice 
I'd keep real close to my own advice 
And howl at the moon 

Oh, you know something I don't know 
You go places I can't go 
You lift your head when the breezes blow 
To voices older than time 

I'll keep you close Oh, I like you near 
I'll touch your head and pull your ear 
And watch you resting while I sit here 
And howl at the moon 

Howl at the moon 
Howl at the moon 
Howl at the moon 

I'll watch you resting while I sit here 
And howl at the moon
