# Hey ladies, ladies

Hey, ladies, ladies,   
advise me, maybe,  
my man is rather rude.  
(He) Beats me when drinking,  
and comes home stinking.  
Tell me what I shall do.

Go to the meadows,  
look in the shadows,  
you'll find a small green weed.
make him a pie,
soon he will die,
and that is all you need.

Go past the parish,  
gather some radish,  
spread it below your eyes
and wear a black veil
to make the telltales
believe that you do cry.
