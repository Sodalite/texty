# Hey ladies, ladies

Hey, ladies, ladies,   
advise me, maybe,  
my man is rather rude.  
Beats me when drinking,  
and comes home stinking.  
Tell me what I shall do.

Go to the meadows,  
look in the shadows,  
you'll find a small green weed.  
Make him a pie,  
soon he will die,  
and that is all you need.

Go past the parish,  
gather horse radish,  
spread it below your eyes.  
And wear a black veil  
to make the telltales  
believe that you can cry.

She picked horse radish,  
made her eyes reddish.  
Under an old pear tree,  
no longer married,  
she had him burried.  
Finally, she is free.
