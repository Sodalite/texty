Mother, leave my father
Mami, vzdej se táty
And get me out of this hell
a vem mě žít o dům dál
Mother, pull the car up
mami, přivez auto
We can make a new life for ourselves
snad můžeme mít svět, co by za to stál.

Mother, leave my father
Mami, vzdej se táty
And save me from this life
a pojď mě zachránit
Mother, get an apartment
mami, najdi si lásku
And learn to love someone kind
co netouží jiné bít. 
Mother, hear my heart
Mami, poslouchej
It's thumping like the skin of a drum
jak zní srdce mé do těla
Mother, I love who you are
mami, já fakt tě mám ráda
But you gotta be the bigger one
ale musíš být dospělá.

Do it for the children
Udělej to pro nás
Do it for the children
udělej to pro nás.

[Chorus]
And we'll start over again
In a house from the magazine
Safe inside a picket fence
With a great big trampoline
And we'll have so many friends
They'll live right on down the street
And we'll never be scared again
We will be a family

[Refrain]
Mother
Leave my father

[Bridge]
I go up
You go down (Da-da-da-da-da)
Way up in the clouds
I go up
You go down (Da-da-da-da-da)
Never coming down
[Refrain]
Mother
Leave my father
(Leave my father now)
Do it for the children
Do it for the children

[Chorus]
And we'll start over again
In a house from the magazine
Safe inside a picket fence
With a great big trampoline
And we'll have so many friends
They'll live right on down the street
And we'll never be scared again
We will be a family, family
And we'll start over again
In a house from the magazine
Safe inside a picket fence
With a great big trampoline
And we'll have so many friends
They'll live right on down the street
And we'll never be scared again
We will be a family, family
